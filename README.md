# City Explorer

**Author**: Skye McCullough

## Overview

In this project, I have used a combination of skills that I have learned in code school along with a variety of online resources in order to build an interactive application that achieves the criteria specified in the following problem domain:
<br />
* Locations: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.

* Map: As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.

* As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

* As a user of City Explorer, I want to see weather info for the city I searched, so that I know how to pack for an upcoming trip.

## Getting Started

Here are the steps you can take to build this app, assuming you already have NodeJS and the Node Package Manager installed. If you do not, [here](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/what-is-node-package-manager) is a good place for you to start.

1. Fork this repo
2. Run `npm init` to set up your npm package
3. Now you can begin downloading and saving your dependencies by running the following commands `npm install axios` , `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap` , and `npm install dotenv`
4. Sign up for a free account at [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/) and retrieve your personal API access token
5. Sign up for a free account at [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) and retrieve your API key
6. Create your local `.env` file to store your API keys while keeping them private.
7. Navigate to your 'server' directory and run the command `node server` to start your server
8. Navigate to your 'client' directory  and run `npm start` to start the fronend and view the app.
